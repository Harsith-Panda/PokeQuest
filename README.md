## 🌍 Overview
**PokeQuest** is a full-stack web application that gamifies real-world exploration.  
Players log in, view their surroundings on a live map, discover virtual Pokémon-like creatures nearby, capture them, and climb a global leaderboard.  

The app integrates **geolocation**, **gamification**, and **real-time web technologies** to deliver an immersive outdoor experience — all through a web interface.

## 🎯 MVP Goal
For the first release (MVP), my focus is to build a **solid foundation** with:
- ✅ User authentication (JWT)
- ✅ Pokémon spawning around user’s location (on-demand + random)
- ✅ Capture mechanism with distance validation
- ✅ Global leaderboard ranked by XP
- ✅ Map visualization using Google Maps API

Future updates will include:
- Real-time spawns (Socket.IO)
- Expiry timers for spawns
- Live leaderboards
- Player battles & trading
